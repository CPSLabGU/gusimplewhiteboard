/**
 *  Contains the current values of sensors located on top of the robot's head (designed for Nao H25 & H21 only)
 * 
 * Examples
 * 
 * Get the state of the Head_Touch_Front sensor
 * 
 *     SensorsHeadSensors s = SensorsHeadSensors_t.get(); //get from the whiteboard
 *     bool button_state = s.Head_Touch_Frontt(); //pull the variable out of the class
 * 
 * Notes:
 * Only the H25 and H21 models have capacitive sensors in the head, indicated by the blue leds on top of the head.
