/**
 * This class is for Vision to report the edge of the SPL soccer field.
 * It does not report the field Bounds, that needs white line detection.
 * This is for the edge of green. 
 * 
 * Results are a percentage of the image utilised, at whatever the resolution and FOV happen to be.
 * You can check the vision status message for resolution and FOV information.
 * Coords:
 *     x, Int16.MinValue <-> Int16.MaxValue
 *     y, Int32.MinValue <-> Int32.MaxValue
 * Minus x Left
 * Plus x Right
 * Plus y Up
 * Minus y Down
 * Center near 0,0
 * 
 * It will always report the projected horizon to the far left X position and the far right position.
 * As such, Y values may be projected to points that are not on the image itself. 
 * That is why the y value is an int32 instead of int16. It uses the same positions for top Y and bottom Y but the values reported may exceed those positions because it's a projection of the horizon.
