 * This class consolidates all the joints into a single wb class of floats [128 bytes/(4 bytes/float) = 32 float values].
 * 
 * Uses for this class are:
 *     Electric Current flowing through joints (expressed in Amps)
 * Possible uses:
 *     Joint Position status
 *     Joint Temperature (Degree C)
 *     Joint Temperature Status (Naoqi Status condition 0-3)
 *
