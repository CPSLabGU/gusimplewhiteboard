uint64_t	visibilityHistory	//a 64-bit history of whether vision said visible 1 or not visible 0. visibilityHistory&0X1 is the most recent fram  
int32_t	frameCounter	//should be provided by vision. 
int16_t	distance	// distance to landmark in cm
int16_t	x	// centre x-coordinate in image  (0,0) is the centre of the image, positive to the right
int16_t	y	// centre  y-coordinate in image	, positive is upwards in the image
int16_t	yaw	//the Yaw in Degrees when the object was last used to generated filtered values. 
bool	isVisible	//is this a credible sighting. 
int16_t	ray_angle	//In degrees, position of the object, positive is left, negative is right, with distance polar position of object in frame of reference of robot. The sign is consistent with the yaw, but not with the fact that x positive is to the right
bool	pad1	//16 bit padding .
